Hackathon 24h group project
this is a very simple group project, made within 24 hours of hackathon, developed by 4 people.
the idea was to creat an app to depressed people, to sugest them some things to do in order to distract them.
We used html, css, bootstrap and javascript.

many thanks to my group:
